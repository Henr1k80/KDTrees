# K-D Trees

This repo was made after an online post I saw about K-D Trees.

Program.cs performs a test.
A random map is created with 10mio points.
10k random points are generated in a list.
Each of these points are run against the TreeStrategy which will then find the closest point(s) on the map for each input point.
This entire run takes below 90ms.
